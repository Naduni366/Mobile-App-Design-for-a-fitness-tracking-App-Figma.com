Fitness-Tracking App for University Students

Welcome to our project! We've designed a hypothetical fitness-tracking app focused on health and wellness, specifically tailored for university students. Created using Figma, this app aims to help students maintain a balanced lifestyle amidst busy schedules. Key features include:

Personalized Fitness Plans: Tailored workout routines based on individual fitness levels and goals.

Activity Tracking: Monitor daily steps, exercise, and overall activity.

Nutrition Guidance: Access to healthy meal plans and nutrition tips.

Mental Wellness: Features supporting mental health include mindfulness exercises and stress management techniques.

Community Support: Connect with fellow students, share progress, and stay motivated.

Explore our design and see how we've envisioned an app that promotes a healthier and more balanced university experience!
